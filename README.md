# FORMANT SHIFT READER
A text-to-speech reader based on formant synthesis with the ability to shift spectrum of all formants or each of them individually as well as change the generator wave function.

This Matlab app was created as a final project for my Speech processing class at Brno University of Technology.


NOTE: Current state of the project is a mess as to the data structure but it works!
